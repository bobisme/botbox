Resumed from previous iteration with claims on bead://botbox/bd-u7n and workspace://botbox/red-falcon. Found the review cr-3spv was created but security reviewer hook (hk-13k) was broken - missing positional arguments ([36mbotbox botbox-security[0m). Fixed by removing broken hook and re-adding with correct args as hk-hkt. Re-requested security review via @botbox-security mention. Security reviewer now running (pid 1939157). Waiting for review on cr-3spv covering 4 beads: bd-u7n, bd-1cu, bd-1lm, bd-3ha (loop journals and iteration-start script).
