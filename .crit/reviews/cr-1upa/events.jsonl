Both are pure formatting/aggregation commands with no side effects.\n\n## Changes\n- Added src/commands/triage.rs (186 lines + tests)\n- Added src/commands/iteration_start.rs (325 lines + tests)\n- Updated src/commands/mod.rs to export new modules\n- Updated src/commands/run.rs with handler implementations\n- Fixed hooks/mod.rs unused exports\n\n## Triage\nWraps bv --robot-triage and formats output with:\n- Triage summary (counts)\n- Top picks (up to 5)\n- Blockers to clear\n- Quick wins\n- Recommendations (up to 6 with reason)\n- Project health metrics\n- ANSI colored output\n- Helpful command hint\n\n## IterationStart\nAggregates four data sources:\n1. Inbox messages (unread count + previews)\n2. Ready beads (open/unblocked with priority/owner)\n3. Pending reviews (awaiting votes, threads with responses)\n4. Active claims (resource claims, filtered for clarity)\n\nLoads config with fallback, handles tool failures gracefully, suggests next action.\n\n## Testing\n- 11 unit tests all passing\n- Triage: 3 tests (parse full/minimal, colors)\n- IterationStart: 8 tests (parse inbox/beads/reviews/claims, filter claims, truncate, colors)\n- Both commands tested manually and work correctly\n\nNo behavior changes, only new functionality."}}

No security concerns found.\n\nThese are pure read-only formatting commands with no user input, no auth, no network operations, and no file writes. Command injection is prevented via workspace name validation. All subprocess invocation uses safe array-based args. Output is properly bounded. Dependencies are standard and safe.\n\nLGTM for merge."}}
