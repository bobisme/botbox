Changes are exclusively prompt template text and regression tests. No new executable code paths, input handling, command interpolation, or security-relevant logic. Template variables ({agent}, {project}) come from validated config, not user input. Protocol command references are hardcoded strings. Unsafe blocks are test-only env var setup (standard Rust 2024 pattern). No security concerns."}}
