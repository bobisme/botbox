All dynamic values in shell commands are validated (validate_bead_id, validate_workspace_name, validate_identifier) and escaped (shell_escape/safe_ident). The sh -c executor only runs programmatically-constructed commands from the shell module builders, not raw user input. The hardcoded 'agent' string fix is a correctness improvement. No injection vectors, no new attack surface from the boolean --execute flag."}}
