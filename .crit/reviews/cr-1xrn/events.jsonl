No security issues found.\n\n**Validated:**\n- No command injection risk (uses Command::new with argument arrays, not shell)\n- Input validation present (validate_name enforces [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]* pattern)\n- TTL value is hardcoded (600 seconds), not user-controlled\n- Consistent with existing JS migration behavior (1.0.11, 1.0.16)\n\n**TTL duration assessment:**\n- 600 seconds (10 minutes) is a reasonable balance between claim refresh overhead and auto-release on crash\n- Trade-off: crashed agents may delay router hook firing by up to 10 minutes until claim expires\n- No configurability, but this is acceptable for initial implementation\n\n**Recommendation:** LGTM - safe to merge."}}
