Also makes sync_hooks dynamically write all eligible hooks from registry instead of hard-coded subset."}}

Array command detection is safe (guarded by len>=4, input from local settings.json). Dynamic hook generation from static registry is safe. validate_name() properly blocks injection. Cross-format retain filter gap is functional only, not exploitable."}}
