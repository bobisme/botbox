Also makes sync_hooks dynamically write all eligible hooks from registry instead of hard-coded subset."}}

Array command detection is safe (guarded by len>=4, input from local settings.json). Dynamic hook generation from static registry is safe. validate_name() properly blocks injection. Cross-format retain filter gap is functional only, not exploitable."}}

Audit changes are read-only detection logic — no command execution. sync_hooks builds commands from static HookRegistry names (compile-time constants) and canonicalized paths, inserted as JSON array elements (not shell-interpolated). validate_name() prevents injection in user-supplied names. The cross-format retain filter gap (LOW from botbox-dev) is functional, not security-relevant."}}
