Includes comprehensive test coverage: 8 golden schema tests ensuring backwards compatibility, race-window test for freshness logic, and updated renderers (text/json/pretty) to include snapshot_at + valid_for_sec + revalidate_cmd fields. Adds COMPATIBILITY.md documenting the additive-only evolution policy and client responsibilities."}}
