Add claim release step (d2) after merging worker workspaces\n2. Release both bead:// and workspace:// claims for dispatched workers\n3. Add orphan cleanup step (2.5) at iteration start to detect stale claims\n4. Detect closed/blocked beads with active claims and release them\n5. Detect workspace claims for non-existent workspaces and release them\n\nTest status: 2 pre-existing test failures in responder.rs (unrelated to this change). Only modified dev_loop/prompt.rs."}}
