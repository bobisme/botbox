Update Justfile, AGENTS.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore, and notes for Rust-only development. ~16,000 lines of JS removed. cargo build/test confirmed working (2 pre-existing test failures in responder route parsing are unchanged)."}}

This change removes ~16k lines of JS code and transitions to Rust-only, which actually improves security posture by eliminating Node.js runtime vulnerabilities and npm supply chain risk. Verified: .gitignore properly excludes secrets, no hardcoded credentials, cargo build succeeds, 91/93 tests pass (2 pre-existing failures noted). Rust's memory safety and type system provide stronger security guarantees than the removed JavaScript code."}}
