# Proposals

This directory contains proposal documents for significant features or changes.

## Lifecycle

Each proposal goes through these stages:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PROPOSAL** | Initial idea captured, design drafted |
| **VALIDATING** | Open questions being investigated |
| **ACCEPTED** | Approved, ready for implementation beads |
| **REJECTED** | Not pursuing, reason documented |

## Creating a Proposal

1. Create a bead with `proposal` label
2. Create `<slug>.md` in this directory using the template in [proposal.md](../../.agents/botbox/proposal.md)
3. Update the bead description to reference the doc

## Template

See `.agents/botbox/proposal.md` for the full workflow and template structure.
