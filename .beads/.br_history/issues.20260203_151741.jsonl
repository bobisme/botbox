Define version in a constant (e.g., BOTBOX_CONFIG_VERSION = '1.0.0')\n3. Loop scripts: Could validate version if needed (optional for now)\n4. doctor command: Check version compatibility (future work)\n\nUse semver format so we can handle breaking changes:\n- Major version: breaking config format changes\n- Minor version: backward-compatible additions\n- Patch version: bug fixes, clarifications\n\nStart at 1.0.0 since this is the first config format.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"botbox-dev","created_at":"2026-02-02T23:53:05.386712105Z","created_by":"botbox-dev","updated_at":"2026-02-02T23:53:54.112547745Z","closed_at":"2026-02-02T23:53:54.112508061Z","close_reason":"Completed: Added version 1.0.0 field to config","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"comments":[{"id":65,"issue_id":"bd-yio","author":"botbox-dev","text":"Added version field to config\n\nChanges:\n- init.mjs: Added BOTBOX_CONFIG_VERSION constant = '1.0.0'\n- init.mjs: Added version field to generated config (first field)\n\nConfig now starts with:\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"project\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nTested: Version field generated correctly.

{"id":"bd-zig","title":"Reduce or remove loop pause in dev/agent scripts","description":"Reduce LOOP_PAUSE now that hook-based spawning eliminates need for polling.\n\nCurrent issue: dev-loop.sh pauses 60s between iterations to allow messages to arrive, but hooks now spawn agents on demand when messages arrive. The long pause just delays completion unnecessarily.\n\nCurrent values:\n- dev-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=60 (60 seconds)\n- agent-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=5 (5 seconds)  \n- reviewer-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=10 (10 seconds)\n\nProposed values:\n- dev-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=2 (brief cooldown, not polling)\n- agent-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=2 (consistent)\n- reviewer-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE=2 (consistent)\n\nOr eliminate entirely (LOOP_PAUSE=0)?\n\nChanges needed:\n1. Update defaults in loop scripts\n2. Update defaults in .botbox.json config generation\n3. Test: Agent completes faster without waiting unnecessarily\n\nRationale: The pause was for polling, but we don't poll anymore. Hook fires → agent spawns → does work → exits quickly. Brief pause (1-2s) is just for rate limiting and letting stdout flush.\n\nTesting: Run agent, verify it exits quickly when no work instead of waiting 60s.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"botbox-dev","created_at":"2026-02-03T00:32:23.808880315Z","created_by":"botbox-dev","updated_at":"2026-02-03T00:33:25.007750541Z","closed_at":"2026-02-03T00:33:25.007723040Z","close_reason":"Completed: Reduced loop pause from 60s to 2s","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"comments":[{"id":67,"issue_id":"bd-zig","author":"botbox-dev","text":"Reduced loop pause to 2 seconds\n\nChanges:\n- dev-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE 60s → 2s\n- agent-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE 5s → 2s  \n- reviewer-loop.sh: LOOP_PAUSE 10s → 2s\n- init.mjs: Config defaults updated (dev.pause: 60 → 2, reviewer.pause: 10 → 2)\n- Updated jq fallback values in all three scripts\n\nRationale: Hook-based spawning eliminates need for polling.
