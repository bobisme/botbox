Use --agent ${DEV_AGENT} on ALL botbus and br commands. Set BOTBOX_PROJECT=r7-eval.

Read .agents/botbox/worker-loop.md and follow it.

You previously decomposed a large task into subtasks. Now execute them.
Pick the next unblocked subtask, work it, finish it, repeat until done.
Then close the parent bead and announce completion."
